# Agentic Workflow

A tiny agentic "framework" that gives e.g. Claude Code a structured workflow to track not only task state but also iterative changes to the design via multiple markdown documents.

Itâ€™s just one concise text file (Workflow.txt) used as context for the LLM.

Strongly consider using this with another document that describes the best practices of your tech stack, e.g. https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/useful_coding_guides_for_llms
